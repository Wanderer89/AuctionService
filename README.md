# AuctionService

The following repository is a result of a thought that came up in the daily general discussions of a group of CS students who have a shared profound interest towards sports. As we all see these fantasy leagues catching the wind everywhere these days, we decided that we'll take up a challenge to build a system that helps people to have a fun auction experience from a given set of players of their choice and also to help us have learnings along the way.

+ The project is still a work in progress. We'll let you know, once it is completed.

Cheers!
